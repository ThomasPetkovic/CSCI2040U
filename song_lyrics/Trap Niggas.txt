Trap niggas (Trap niggas, trap niggas, trap niggas)
Trap niggas, yeah-yeah (Trap niggas, trap niggas, trap niggas)
Times gettin' hard but a nigga still gettin' it
Young rich niggas, in this motherfucker, huh (Trap niggas, trap niggas, trap niggas)

[Chorus]
When you wake, before you brush your teeth, you grab your strap, nigga
Only time you get down on your knees, shootin' crap, nigga
Fuck what you heard, God blessin' all the trap niggas (Trap niggas, trap niggas)
God blessin' all them trap niggas
When you wake, before you brush your teeth, you grab your strap, nigga
Only time you get down on your knees, shootin' crap, nigga
Fuck what you heard, God blessin' all the trap niggas (Trap niggas, trap niggas)
God blessin' all them trap niggas

[Verse 1]
Weighed 1,008 grams on the scale (On the scale)
I got a lower case T across my chest (Need that cross)
Your crack house doin' numbers, then you blessed (Know you blessed)
You move your momma to a crib from the 'jects (Move momma)
It's so much alcohol and kush on my breath (It's all I know)
We prayin' five times a day to catch a plug (For that la-la, trap)
A few bean pies stashed in the truck (They want la-la)
Shoot dice all day and sell dust (Sell dust, trap)
You loaded up, they talkin' shit, you gon' bust (Gon' bust)
Told yourself a million times, you don't give a fuck  (Overdose, trap)
Sold over a million dimes, hangin' in the cut (Roll it over)
Sold over a million dimes, I don't give a fuck (Trap life)
What?


[Chorus]
When you wake, before you brush your teeth, you grab your strap, nigga
Only time you get down on your knees, shootin' crap, nigga
Fuck what you heard, God blessin' all the trap niggas (Trap niggas, trap niggas)
God blessin' all the trap niggas
When you wake, before you brush your teeth, you grab your strap, nigga
Only time you get down on your knees, shootin' crap, nigga
Fuck what you heard, God blessin' all the trap niggas (Trap niggas, trap niggas)
God blessin' all them trap niggas

[Verse 2]
Hasta Ia-la-uego wake up with that Glock, okay though (Oh no)
Stash the dope inside a Winnebago in Decatur (Oh no)
You got your work, you posted up in the hood Bodega (What, what, slut)
Lil' woadie loadin' up that yopper 'fore he brush his teeth (That what?)
Gotta roll the backwood up while he countin' cheese (That smoke)
We on the turf, gettin' active on the backstreet (We were)
I'm drinkin' Actavis, the only thing relax me (Pour up)
I'm on drugs, every single day I pop a seal (Trap)
We talk that lingo 'round here, we try and work a deal (Deal)
You pull up round here, they serve you here to Dixie Hills (Trap)
You hit Old Nat, I know on Godby you'll see a trap house
Gotta cock it back, out here, this shit wid-ild

[Chorus]
When you wake, before you brush your teeth, you grab your strap, nigga
Only time you get down on your knees, shootin' crap, nigga
Fuck what you heard, God blessin' all the trap niggas (Trap niggas, trap niggas)
God blessin' all them trap niggas
When you wake, before you brush your teeth, you grab your strap, nigga
Only time you get down on your knees, shootin' crap, nigga
Fuck what you heard, God blessin' all the trap niggas (Trap niggas, trap niggas)
God blessin' all them trap niggas


[Outro]
You loaded up, they talk shit, you gon' bust
Told yourself a million times, you don't give a fuck (Trap)
Sold over a million dimes, hangin' in the cut
Sold over a million dimes, I don't give a fuck (Yeah)
What?
(Trap niggas)
